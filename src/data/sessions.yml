    We usually think of technology as a tool, something as indifferent as a hammer or a ruler. But in a world where
    algorithms decide which version of the news you read, pretending our software is detached is naive—or even
    dangerous. Technology has become an intermediary in nearly every part of our lives, from electronic medical
    records to online bill-pay systems to apps that remember which craft beers you’ve tasted.

    So, when so few technologists (that’s us) are creating software for use by so many (that’s nearly everyone else in
    the world), how can we do right by them? What responsibility do we have to use our skills for good? And how can we
    get this right when humans beings insist on being so varied and complicated and, well… human?

    10 years ago I was a lonely developer sitting in a small room quietly turning out code between 9am and 5pm, Monday
    to Friday. Fast-forward to now and you'll see me standing in front of audiences all around the world talking to
    developers about numerous topics."Why are you bragging like that at me?" I hear you ask. Because it could happen
    to you too.

    The question I always ask myself is "How the hell did that happen?!?!".

    The truth is that the only reason I've managed to advance my career so far in a decade is because of the people
    that make up the communities of open source projects. Not only do open source projects save you time and money,
    but the friendships and support groups that can be made within these communities is, frankly, staggering.

    Join me as I chart my journey from wage monkey to conference speaker, and look at how you can leverage the power of
    open source to make real friends, real money, and real happiness.

# JAVASCRIPT
- title: "Accessibility: Don't turn off that JavaScript just yet!"
  level: entry
  category: javascript
  type: regular
  description: |
    Long gone are the days when you couldn't use JavaScript on a site and make it work for people with disabilities.
    Many now even use JavaScript to increase accessibility, and not just by throwing in a couple ARIA tags. Considering
    accessibility when building scripts remains essential! We will look at a few ways to use JavaScript and ensure that 
    accessibility is not only preserved, but even improved.

    Things have changed. It wasn't so many years ago that some accessibility experts would turn off JavaScript to test 
    a site and deem it inaccessible if they couldn't use the site. Assistive technology, including screenreaders, have 
    come a long way and can interact with JavaScript, if accessibility has been kept in mind. Surveys consistently show 
    that over 97% of screenreader users have JavaScript enabled. Not to mention people with disabilities that don't use 
    screenreader software and also have JavaScript enabled. Planning for (and maintaining) a  solution is not going to 
    make a page accessible.

    If you develop websites or web-based applications and use JavaScript, this presentation is for you. People with 
    disabilities account for over a billion people worldwide. That's roughly 15% of the world population who experiences 
    challenges on the web because they can't see the screen, hear media files, use a mouse, concentrate for long periods 
    of time, perceive colors, etc. This, in effect, makes people with disabilities the world's largest minority on the 
    web with $220 Billion in discretionary spending power in the United States alone. Much bigger and influential than 
    any other minority. Considering the needs of this population is only wise.

    In this presentation, I will talk about some of the issues that can arise from using JavaScript, and how to use it 
    while maintaining accessibility. I will briefly discuss ARIA, but the meat of the presentation will consist of:

    - Event handlers
    - Pop-up windows
    - Page refreshes
    - JavaScript generated content.

    Takeaway for the audience

    The audience will gain an understanding of the impact of disabilities on using the web, beyond screenreaders, and 
    will see some simple ways to improve the accessibility of common tasks conducted with JavaScript.

    find it to be the most productive way to work with JavaScript. In this talk, Doris will go through how TypeScript 
    enables you to leverage features from the current and future of JavaScript while increasing the productivity of
    JavaScript development across the board. As ECMAScript 6 gains popularity and more browsers are implementing the
    standard, JavaScript developers across the board are beginning to wonder, 'what's next?'  This session will cover
    some of the latest features of TypeScript, including future ECMAScript proposals, support for Angular, React/JSX
    and Node, the state of the art type system capabilities, and how it all comes together to make working and
    creating things in JavaScript more productive and fun with TypeScript.

    A large part of Drupal's appeal lies in its flexibility. The fact that a developer can alter, extend, and enhance
    almost any aspect of Drupal without having to hack core. Knowing what systems are available for doing so, and how
    to make use of them is critical for anyone developing with Drupal.

    Drawing from my experience helping to document and explain these new patterns in various formats I hope to answer
    these questions:

    - What are hooks, plugins, events, and services?
    - What problems do these patterns seek to solve?
    - How do I decide which method to use and when?
    - Looking ahead to the future, how do these patterns affect the code I write today?

    If you're currently writing modules for Drupal 8, porting modules from Drupal 7, or think that you might have to
    sometime in the future, or even if you're just curious how the module ecosystem fits together behind the scenes
    this session contains critical information for you. After attending this session you should have all the background
    information you need to make informed decisions about how your custom code can, and should, talk to Drupal in order
    to uphold best practices and write modules that are easy to maintain and play well with others.

    This talk will briefly introduce what microservices are, and how to create them using middleware. Then show how to
    build using the Zend Expressive microframework leveraging components of Zend Framework, and other libraries, to
    quickly create awesome things without requiring a full stack framework. Resources for reference and continued

    But hold on there my framework friend, a rewrite is costly and is rarely the correct answer.

    We'll discuss some common pitfalls when getting a legacy codebase ready for PHP 7 and what we can do to make the

This is most helpful in our reporting interfaces.  We can build, change, and throw away our reports very easily.  This is much easier than our older reports being generated by large SQL queries.

    Attendees will learn:

    The promise is a bit hard to wrap your head around though. This talk will explain exactly how a promise works and
    behaves and how you should interact with it.

    Next, we'll dig into generators. Generators have been added to PHP 5.5 and Ecmascript 6 and makes creating and
    consuming iterators a lot easier.

    Generators have a unique language property though. They allow us to jump in the middle of any method outside that
    method. In the third part of the talk we'll show how we can use iterators to improve promise-heavy code and make
    asynchronous code look and behave as normal code.,

    examples of how to use each with PHPUnit and Prophecy. Layered on top of this we will observe the difference
    between sociable and solitary tests, as coined by Jeffrey Fields. Lastly, we will look at how test smells
    naturally surface and what strategies can be used to mitigate them, such as Arrange-Act-Assert, object mothers

    "The Mythical Man-month" is one of the seminal books in the field of software project management.  It was written
    in 1975, based on experience from the 1960s.  Is it even still relevant?

    Turns out, it is.  Technology may have changed dramatically but people have not.  Managing software projects is
    about managing people, not bits, and creative people engaged in intellectual endeavors are notoriously hard to
    predict and manage.  (Just ask my project manager.)
 
    Fortunately, many of the lessons-learned Brooks' presents are still relevant today.  Some are directly applicable
    ("adding people to a late project makes it later") while others are valid with a little interpretation.  Still
    others fly in the face of conventional wisdom.  What can we learn from that?

    This session will present a modern overview of the ideas presented by Brooks and a look at what we can still learn

    As a developer, you spend your entire life learning.  But what happens when the tables are turned and you become
    the teacher?  Do you want to become a conference speaker or a mentor, talk to your local user group, give
    presentations at work, or become a technical trainer?  As a previous classroom teacher with a Master's Degree in
    Curriculum Development, I will take you on a journey to understand the various learning styles and how to
    effectively reach everyone.  We will look at how to present your information, best ways to structure it, and learn
    ways to reach all students no matter their level.  We will also cover a number of best practices for crafting your
    presentation decks themselves.  Join me for this exploration into the inner workings of the human mind.

    Being a developer, programmer, analyst, tester, designer, etc is hard. We work in an industry that champions
    the 12+ hour work day; continued learning and open source contributions, but not on the company's dollar. We're
    continually berated with the idea of the 10x developer and so we must work harder, read more blogs, write more
    code and buy more books but when will it ever end? Will technology ever stand still long enough to let us all
    catch up? No. You'll always be busy, busy playing catch up in a race you didn't sign up for.

    Fortunately, there's another way. Instead of being busy, I can help you be more productive. I will walk you through
    some of the tools and techniques that I use on a daily basis to, not only, maintain and upgrade my skills in the
    world of ever changing technology, but, and more importantly, to protect my sanity, be more present and remove
    stress and fear from my life.
