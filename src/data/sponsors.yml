      conferences and companies</b>, <a href="https://osmihelp.org/research" target="_blank">conducting research</a>,
      and <a href="https://osmihelp.org/resources" target="_blank">creating documentation</a> to assist companies in making
      supportive environments for those impacted by mental health disorders. He is assisted in these efforts by
      selfless board members and volunteers who bring their time and expertise to bear on this important issue.
