speaker: Eryn O'Neil
bio: |
  Eryn O’Neil is a freelance PHP developer and tech lead. Coming from the agency world, she has worked on everything
  from e-commerce and online promotions, to sites for rad Minnesota organizations (shoutout to NiceRide and Doomtree!),
  to developing a proprietary framework and CMS. Her philosophy is to build software by placing humans first: both the
  people who will use it and the developers who build it with you (and maintain it afterward). Based in Minneapolis,
  Eryn spends most of her free time blues dancing, flying on a trapeze, and wishing it weren’t snowing.
