"bio": |
  Like many developers, Hilary Stohs-Krause started out building websites while still a kid ... but, unlike most, hers was dedicated to _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_.

  As an 11-year-old, Hilary didnâ€™t know she could make websites for a living, so in college, she pursued a different passion: journalism. Over the ensuing decade-plus, she wrote, edited, designed, managed and radioâ€™d her way to a position as an award-winning journalist who freelanced for NPR and taught journalists how to incorporate the web into their writing.

  Now, as a full-stack developer for [Ten Forward Consulting](http://tenforward.consulting) in Madison, WI, part of her job is to incorporate writing into our web applications. She spearheaded and now directs Ten Forward's [company blog](http://tenforward.consulting/blog), edits copy for client blogs, and writes and edits content for client sites, in addition to front-end and back-end development and some design.

  She's passionate about increasing inclusivity in tech, and volunteers at youth coding events through various Madison-area organizations, as well as tutoring students at the Madison YWCAâ€™s [web development bootcamp](http://ywebca.org/). She's a primary organizer for the [Madison Women in Tech meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Madison-Women-in-Tech/), which has more than 600 members.

  Hilary has two ragdoll-siamese cats, Gus and Baxter, and once climbed the border fence between the U.S. and Mexico. She like porters and American Pale Ales, mango sherbet and garlic-stuffed olives. Sheâ€™ll read any fantasy or sci-fi she can get her hands on.
