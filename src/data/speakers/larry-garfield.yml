speaker: Larry Garfield
bio: |
  Larry Garfield has been building websites since he was a sophomore in high school, which is longer ago than he'd like
  to admit.  Larry has been an active Drupal contributor and consultant for over a decade, and led the Drupal 8 Web
  Services initiative that helped transform Drupal into a modern PHP platform.

  Larry is Director of Runtimes and Integrations at Platform.sh, a leading continuous deployment cloud hosting
  company.  He is responsible for Platform's container-based products and developer advocacy, with an aim to make
  hosting major OSS projects with Platform.sh "stupid easy".  He is also still a de facto Drupal developer evangelist
  within the PHP community, as well as the Drupal representative to the Framework Interoperability Group.

  Larry holds a Master's degree in Computer Science from DePaul University.  He blogs at both [http://platform.sh/](http://platform.sh/)
  and [http://www.garfieldtech.com/](http://www.garfieldtech.com/).
