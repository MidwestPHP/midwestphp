speaker: Gary Hockin
bio: |
  Gary Hockin travels all over the world empowering users of PhpStorm as a Developer Advocate for JetBrains (fine
  purveyors of quality IDEs). He is a talented and evocative speaker, a cultivated author of impressively entertaining
  blog posts, and records elegant and informative screencasts and videos. Gary's also a contributor to the Zend
  Framework and is argumentative enough to be on the community review team.

  When Gary had a real job, he was a developer of at least "competent" standard with nearly 20 years experience. When
  not developing, speaking about developing, reading about developing or writing about developing, Gary enjoys playing
  computer games, and arguing with his wife and two kids. Gary has recently discovered that conferences ask speakers
  to write their own biography text, and you can get away with writing pretty much anything you want.
