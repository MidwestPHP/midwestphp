                            held in Bloomington, Minnesota on March 17th and 18th. Since we started in 2013, we’ve
                            continued to experience great growth and that starts with our Speakers and most of all our
                            Sponsors.</p>
                        <p>This year we are pleased to let you know that the Midwest PHP Conference will be held at the

                            visibility as our attendees enter the conference and walk between sessions. We continue to
                            run the conference un- der the North Foundation’s 501(c)(3) status allowing a portion of
                            your sponsorship (less fair market value of the tickets) to be tax-deductible. Finally, we
                            continue to see a year over year growth with-in the number of people who attend the Midwest
                            PHP conference, which exposes you and your brand to a larger audience then you have in
                            year’s past.</p>
