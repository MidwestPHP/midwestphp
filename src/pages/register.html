            <h3>Cancellation Policy<small>.</small></h3>
            <p>Cancellations of conference registrations made prior to December 15th are subject to a cancellation fee.
                Cancellations made thereafter are nonrefundable. All cancellations must be made via our Contact Form.
                Substitutions
                may be made at any time, also by using our Contact Form. Confirmed registrants who do not attend the
                conference
                will
                not receive a refund and are liable for the entire fee. Cancellations of travel and hotel arrangements
                are the
                responsibility of the registrant. Midwest PHP reserves the right to refuse registrations. Due to
                insurance
                restrictions, no one under 18 will be admitted to the conference. All speakers, programs and
                descriptions are
                subject to change without notice.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>VAT Invoices<small>.</small></h3>
            <p>This conference is organized by a U.S. based entity and is held in the U.S. Thus there is no need of a
                VAT
                invoice
                for registrations of EU based attendees. After registration a confirmation email with all related
                financial
                information is automatically sent to the registrant. Nothing more is available.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>International Attendees<small>.</small></h3>
            <p>The only exception to our cancellation policy is in the case of an international attendee not being
                granted a
                U.S.
                Visa to enter the country, because they must purchase a ticket in order to receive an invitation letter
                to
                include
                in the U.S. Visa application.</p>

            <p>For those attendees who are required to gain a U.S. Visa there are some steps that need to be
                followed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, purchase a ticket to the conference.</li>
                <li>Then, send us the vital information below so we can generate an invitation letter for you.</li>
                <li>Wait for the invitation letter, typically 1 to 2 days. (Here is a sample)</li>
                <li>If your U.S. Visa application is rejected, simply email us a copy of the rejection letter for
                    immediate full
                    refund
                    which will go back on the card used for purchase.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The information we need to prepare the invitation letter is:</p>

            <b>Name:</b> {name}<br/>
            <b>Job Title:</b> {title}<br/>
            <b>Company:</b> {company}<br/>
