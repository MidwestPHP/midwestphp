                <p>We have a <a href="{{root}}/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> that details the standards of behaviour that we expect from participants at
                    this event, and actions that the organisers may take when those standards are breached.</p>
                <p>Every participant, including organisers, and contract staff members, have agreed to abide by the
                    terms of this Code of Conduct.</p>
                <p>If another participantâ€™s behaviour is making you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or threatened, you can
                    contact a member of our incident response team using one of the following methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email: <a href="mailto:safety@north-foundation.org">safety@north-foundation.org</a></li>
                    <li>Phone: <a href="tel:612-405-8682">(612) 405-8682</a> (24 hours)</li>
                    <li>Go to the check-in desk and ask for a member of the incident response team.</li>
                    <li>Our incident response team will take steps to de-escalate an incident, take a report from you,
                        and pass it onto conference organisers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This year, our incident response team consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jonathan Sundquist (conference organiser)</li>
                    <li>Mike Willbanks (conference organiser)</li>
                    <li>Kelly Sundquist (conference organiser)</li>
                    <li>John Koniges (conference organiser)</li>
                    <li>Wyatt Andersen (conference organiser)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are not comfortable with the first person who responds to your report taking further action,
                    you may ask for a different member of the team.</p>
                <p>If you feel that you have not been taken seriously or that an incident was not responded to in a
                    satisfactory way, you can ask for North Foundation, the parent body of Midwest PHP to review the
                    way your report was handled.</p>
                <p>You can e-mail the Midwest PHP board at <a href="mailto:info@midwestphp.org">info@midwestphp.org</a>.
